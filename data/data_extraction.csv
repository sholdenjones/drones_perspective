Animals disperse the seeds of 60%-90% of trees in tropical rainforests, which are among the most structurally complex ecosystems on Earth. Here, we investigated how 3D rainforest structure influences the movements of large, frugivorous birds and resulting spatial patterns of seed dispersal. We GPS-tracked white-thighed (Bycanistes albotibialis) and black-casqued hornbills (Ceratogymna atrata) in a study area surveyed by light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in southern Cameroon. We found that both species preferred areas of greater canopy height and white-thighed hornbill preferred areas of greater vertical complexity. In addition, 33% of the hornbills preferred areas close to canopy gaps, while 16.7% and 27.8% avoided large and small gaps, respectively. White-thighed hornbills avoided swamp habitats, while black-casqued increased their preference for swamps during the hottest temperatures. We mapped spatial probabilities of seed dispersal by hornbills, showing that 3D structural attributes shape this ecological process by influencing hornbill behaviour. These results provide evidence of a possible feedback loop between rainforest vegetation structure and seed dispersal by animals. Interactions between seed dispersers and vegetation structure described here are essential for understanding ecosystem functions in tropical rainforests and critical for predicting how rainforests respond to anthropogenic impacts. This study shows how 3D vegetation structure shapes spatial patterns of seed dispersal by influencing hornbill habitat selection. The seed dispersal modelling framework can be applied to any system with available animal movement data, providing a method to quantify the spatial probability of events occurring due to animal habitat selection.image",Cameroon,USA,Wet tropical,Forest,Dja Faunal Reserve,"3°11′N, 12°48′ E",,,not reported,Not listed,LiDAR,Zenmuse L1 waveform scanner,300 points m−,300 ppm,25 km2,25 km2,Scan of study area completed,no,1 month,1 scan,1 scan completed in March 2022,Not listed,"Canopy Height Model, Vertical Forest Structure, Distance to Canopy Gaps","Distance to small canopy gaps, Distance to large canopy gaps",Animal ecology,Understand how 3D forest structure influences the movement and subsequent seed dispersal behavior of hornbills,3D structure influences hornbill behavior and habitat suitability,Used to collect 3D forest structure data,Not listed,"https:// doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25857385.v, (movebank.org,  study name “Hornbill e-obs Cameroon”, study ID 2016993973)",Not listed

However, the structural complexity of many tropical forests makes it difficult to determine canopy positions. The integration of remote sensing and ground-based data enables this determination and measurements of how canopy and understory trees differ in structure and dynamics. Here we analyzed 2 cm resolution RGB imagery collected by a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS), also known as drone, together with two decades of bi-annual tree censuses for 2 ha of old growth forest in the Central Amazon. We delineated all crowns visible in the imagery and linked each crown to a tagged stem through field work. Canopy trees constituted 40% of the 1244 inventoried trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) > 10 cm, and accounted for similar to 70% of aboveground carbon stocks and wood productivity. The probability of being in the canopy increased logistically with tree diameter, passing through 50% at 23.5 cm DBH. Diameter growth was on average twice as large in canopy trees as in understory trees. Growth rates were unrelated to diameter in canopy trees and positively related to diameter in understory trees, consistent with the idea that light availability increases with diameter in the understory but not the canopy. The whole stand size distribution was best fit by a Weibull distribution, whereas the separate size distributions of understory trees or canopy trees > 25 cm DBH were equally well fit by exponential and Weibull distributions, consistent with mechanistic forest models.

We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the impact of flight speed (2, 4, 6 m/s), flight height (40, 50 m above ground level), and camera angle (-45 degrees, -90 degrees) on spider monkey counts in a closed-canopy forest in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico.

Detection errors, both observer (animal is available for detection but missed/misidentified by the observer) and availability errors (animal is present but unavailable for detection), vary across species, habitats and flight parameters, and may be exacerbated by anti-predator responses. We evaluated the suitability of drone-mounted TIR cameras in surveys of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) by measuring detection errors for different flight altitudes (70, 60, 50 and 40 m above ground level [AGL]) and camera angles (45 degrees and 90 degrees) in two secondary forest habitats in Mauritius, characterized by open canopy with low thermal contrast and closed canopy with high thermal contrast. First, we determined the true size of three habituated macaque groups with full-day follows, and assessed their response to the drone. Next, we measured availability error (detection rate) in TIR videos after correcting for observer error (misidentification rate) using corresponding red-green-blue (RGB) videos. Finally, we assessed whether adjusting counts with mean detection rates improved group size estimates for different flight parameter combinations. Both error types were lowest for morning flights at 50 and 60 m AGL (40 and 50 m above canopy respectively) and with 45 degrees camera angle in high thermal contrast conditions. The higher detection rates at 50 and 60 m compared to 40 m resulted from milder anti-predator behaviours (increased vigilance instead of dispersal). In secondary forest habitats with few dominant canopy species (e.g. Eucalyptus, Litsea and Pinus spp.), and for primate species with behavioural ecology comparable to long-tailed macaques, we recommend surveying at 40-50 m above closed-canopy vegetation with a 45 degrees camera angle.

Unlike traditional PolInSAR-based methods, the proposed method reformulates the forest height inversion as a pan-sharpening process between the low-resolution LiDAR height and the high-resolution PolSAR and PolInSAR features. A tailored Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) called PolGAN with one generator and dual (coherence and spatial) discriminators is proposed to this end, where a progressive pan-sharpening strategy underpins the generator to overcome the significant difference between spatial resolutions of LiDAR and SAR-related inputs. Forest height estimates with high spatial resolution and vertical accuracy are generated through a continuous generative and adversarial process. UAVSAR PolInSAR and LVIS LiDAR data collected over tropical and boreal forest sites are used for experiments. Ablation study is conducted over the boreal site evidencing the superiority of the progressive generator with dual discriminators employed in PolGAN (RMSE: 1.21 m) in comparison with the standard generator with dual discriminators (RMSE: 2.43 m) and the progressive generator with a single coherence (RMSE: 2.74 m) or spatial discriminator (RMSE: 5.87 m). Besides that, by reducing the dependency on theoretical models and utilizing the shape, texture, and spatial information embedded in the high-spatial-resolution features, the PolGAN method achieves an RMSE of 2.37 m over the tropical forest site, which is much more accurate than the traditional PolInSAR-based Kapok method (RMSE: 8.02 m).",USA,USA,Moist tropical,Forest,Howland research forest northeast of Bangor in the U.S. state of Maine; Lope National Park located in central Gabon,"44°48′41′’ N to 45°10′18′’ N; 68°34′22′’ W to 68°45′48′’ W and 0°2′12′’ S to 0°19′34′’ S, 11°27′31′’ E to 11°43′29′’ E",from study,,"Fixed-wing, Commercial",Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar,LiDAR,LVIS laser altimeter,20–25 m,22.5 m,not reported,,"LVIS data over the Howland site were captured on 6 August 2009 with a 20 m footprint diameter, an 8.5 km flight altitude, and a 1.7 km swath width.

In Panama, orey grows in monospecific stands or is the dominant species in inundated mixed forests, mainly along the coasts of Bocas del Toro province and Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé. The species was known to occur in Darien province, in the Pacific, although almost no information on its distribution and forest extension in the region existed. Objective: To describe the structure and floristics of orey forests in Darien, map their extension, and propose a model for their regeneration strategy. Methods: This work is part of a vegetation mapping project of the Matusagaratí complex of wetlands. It includes the use of drones, ground truthing, vegetation sampling through temporary plots, and general plant collecting. A supervised classification of a Landsat satellite image was performed to delimit the orey forest extension. To study the orey forest regeneration strategy, a digitalization of forest gaps in high resolution WorldView-2 and Planet Scope images was performed. Gap frequency and turnover time for forest stands were calculated. Results: Several monospecific orey mature forest patches were found in remote areas of the Matusagaratí com-plex of wetlands, for a total of 1 267 hectares. A description of the floristics and structure of orey forests in Darien is presented. A conceptual model of orey mature forest development and gap regeneration is proposed. Conclusions: Our knowledge of the floristic composition, structure and distribution of orey forests in the Republic of Panama has increased.

However, the complexity of these landscapes makes it difficult to assess abundance and distribution of some species using ground-based surveys alone. Here, we deployed a combination of ground-transects and aerial surveys to determine drivers of the critically endangered Bornean Orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus morio) distribution across a large multiple-use landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Ground-transects and aerial surveys using drones were conducted for orangutan nests and hemi-epiphytic strangler fig trees (Ficus spp.) (an important food resource) in 48 survey areas across 76 km(2), within a study landscape of 261 km(2). Orangutan nest count data were fitted to models accounting for variation in land use, above-ground carbon density (ACD, a surrogate for forest quality), strangler fig density, and elevation (between 117 and 675 m). Orangutan nest counts were significantly higher in all land uses possessing natural forest cover, regardless of degradation status, than in monoculture plantations. Within these natural forests, nest counts increased with higher ACD and strangler fig density, but not with elevation. In logged forest (ACD 14-150 Mg ha(-1)), strangler fig density had a significant, positive relationship with orangutan nest counts, but this relationship disappeared in a forest with higher carbon content (ACD 150-209 Mg ha(-1)). Based on an area-to-area comparison, orangutan nest counts from ground transects were higher than from counts derived from aerial surveys, but this did not constitute a statistically significant difference. Although the difference in nest counts was not significantly different, this analysis indicates that both methods under-sample the total number of nests present within a given area. Aerial surveys are, therefore, a useful method for assessing the orangutan habitat use over large areas. However, the under-estimation of nest counts by both methods suggests that a small number of ground surveys should be retained in future surveys using this technique, particularly in areas with dense understory vegetation. This study shows that even highly degraded forests may be a suitable orangutan habitat as long as strangler fig trees remain intact after areas of forest are logged.

Our aim is to present and promote innovative low-cost (<$3000) UAV applications in volcanology to reduce costs and improve high-resolution quality (up to 8 cm/pixel) data acquisition in highly dynamic landscapes. Our results contribute to the state of the art of UAV applications in volcanic landforms in tropical developing countries where nearly half of the globally active volcanoes are located. Our findings prove that UAV's are a low-cost technique that can map large extensions of geomorphological features with accessibility limitations due to geological hazards and/or private property restrictions in short time. We surveyed four active volcanic sites in Costa Rica, Central America to illustrate potential applications of UAV mapping and geomorphological analysis of lava flows, debris avalanches, lahar deposits (debris flows) and biogeomorphic landscape changes due to forest succession. Analysis derived from the digital imagery captured by the UAV allowed to determine accurate volume calculations, surface roughness characteristics, morphometric quantifications, supervised surface classifications, and in combination with hydraulic modelling to assess hazards in urban planning.

Traditional 3D products generated with digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) have shown great potential in estimating AGB, tree density, diameter at breast height, height, and basal area in forest ecosystems. However, these traditional products explore only a small part of the structural information contained in the 3D data, thus not leveraging the full potential of the data for inventory purposes. In this study, we tested the performance of 3D products derived from DAP and a technique based on Fourier transforms of vertical profiles of vegetation to estimate AGB, tree density, diameter at breast height, height, and basal area in a secondary fragment of Atlantic Forest located in northeast Brazil. Field measurements were taken in 30 permanent plots (0.25 ha each) to estimate AGB. At the time of the inventory, we also performed a digital aerial mapping of the entire forest fragment with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Based on the 3D point clouds and the digital terrain model (DTM) obtained by DAP, vertical vegetation profiles were produced for each plot. Using traditional structure metrics and metrics derived from Fourier transforms of profiles, regression models were fit to estimate AGB, tree density, diameter at breast height, height, and basal area. The 3D DAP point clouds represented the forest canopy with a high level of detail, regardless of the vegetation density. The metrics based on the Fourier transform of profiles were selected as predictors in all models produced.

In this study, we measured VNIR (visible-near infrared (400-1050 nm)) reflectance of individual sun and shade leaves in 7 one-ha tropical forest plots located along a 1200-2000 mm precipitation gradient in West Africa. We collected hyperspectral imaging data from 3 of the 7 plots, using an octocopter-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), mounted with a hyperspectral mapping system (450-950 nm, 9 nm FWHM). Using partial least squares regression (PLSR), we found that the spectra of individual sun leaves demonstrated significant (p < 0.01) correlations with LMA and leaf chemical traits: r(2) = 0.42 (LMA), r(2) = 0.43 (N), r(2) = 0.21 (P), r(2) = 0.20 (leaf potassium (K)), r(2) = 0.23 (leaf calcium (Ca)) and r(2) = 0.14 (leaf magnesium (Mg)). Shade leaf spectra displayed stronger relationships with all leaf traits. At the airborne level, four of the six leaf traits demonstrated weak (p < 0.10) correlations with the UAV-collected spectra of 58 tree crowns: r(2) = 0.25 (LMA), r(2) = 0.22 (N), r(2) = 0.22 (P), and r(2) = 0.25 (Ca). From the airborne imaging data, we used LMA, N and P values to map the LES across the three plots, revealing precipitation and substrate as co-dominant drivers of trait distributions and relationships. Positive N-P correlations and LMA-P anticorrelations followed typical LES theory, but we found no classic trade-offs between LMA and N. Overall, this study demonstrates the application of UAVs to generating LES information and advancing the study and monitoring tropical forest functional diversity.",Ghana,UK,"Wet tropical, Moist tropical",Forest,"Ankasa Conservation Area, Bobiri Forest Reserve, Kogyae Strict Nature Reserve","5.2680, -2.6955; 6.6910, -1.3389; 7.3012, -1.1649",from study,"5.268000, -2.695500; 6.691000, -1.338900; 7.301200, -1.164900",Multi-rotor,Octocopter (custom),"RGB, Hyperspectral",WageningenUR HYMSY,3 cm (RGB); 20 cm (DSM); 50 cm (Hyperspectral),".03 m, .5 m",3 plots of 1 ha each (part of 7 total plots),3 ha,UAV data from 3 of 7 plots along precipitation gradient,no,March 2016,One time point,Single campaign March 2016,not reported,not reported,"Leaf Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium; Leaf traits",Carbon and nutrient fluxes,To map leaf economic spectrum traits using UAV hyperspectral data in West African forests,"UAV spectra predicted LMA and chemical traits (N, P, Ca) with moderate accuracy.",Collected hyperspectral canopy reflectance data for mapping leaf economic spectrum traits.,not reported,NA,not reported

Quantifying these dynamics and understanding their drivers at relevant spatial scales has long been a challenge. Recent progress in open access imagery sources with improved spatial, spectral and temporal resolution combined with cloud computing resources, and the advent of relatively cheap solutions to deploy laser sensors in the field, have transformed this domain of study. We present a study case in the Mpem & Djim National Park (MDNP), a 1,000 km(2) protected area in the Centre region of Cameroon. Using open source algorithms in Google Earth Engine (GEE), we characterized vegetation dynamics and the fire regime based on Landsat multispectral imagery archive (1975-2020). Current species assemblages were estimated from Sentinel 2 imagery and the open source biodivMapR package, using spectral dissimilarity. Vegetation structure (aboveground biomass; AGB) was characterized using Unmanned Aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR scanning data sampled over the study area.

Species assemblage computed from spectral dissimilarity in forest vegetation followed a successional gradient consistent with forest age. AGB accumulation rate was 3.2 Mg.ha(-1).year(-1) after 42 years of forest encroachment. In savannas, two modes could be identified along the gradient of spectral species assemblage, corresponding to distinct AGB levels, where woody savannas with low fire frequency store 40% more AGB than open grassy savannas with high fire frequency. A fire occurrence every five year was found to be the fire regime threshold below which woody savannas start to dominate over grassy ones. A fire frequency below that threshold opens the way to young forest transitions. These results have implications for carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation policies.

In this study, SV-OVOCs were collected in the horizontal plane of the roughness layer over the tropical forest in the central Amazon during the wet season of 2018. A sampler mounted to a copter-type, hovering unmanned aerial vehicle was used. Underlying the collection region, a plateau forest transitioned into a slope forest across several hundred meters. The concentrations of pinonic and pinic acids, which are monoterpene oxidation products, had no statistical difference over the two forests. By comparison, across the study period, differences in the concentration of 2-methyltetrols, which are products of isoprene oxidation, ranged from -70% to +480% over the two forests. The chemical lifetime of 2-methyltetrols in the atmosphere is sufficiently long that heterogeneity in the isoprene emission rate from the two forests followed by atmospheric oxidation does not explain the concentration heterogeneity of 2-methyltetrols. Standing waves and local meteorology also cannot account for the heterogeneity. Of the possibilities considered, the most plausible explanation is the direct emission from the forest of 2-methyltetrols produced through biological processes within the plants. Under this explanation, the rate of direct SV-OVOC emissions should be modulated by forest type and related environmental stressors.

The main objective of this investigation was to study and develop techniques for the generation of HDSMs in forest areas using novel hyperspectral 2D frame camera technologies. An approach based on object-space image matching was developed, adapting the traditional vertical line locus (VLL) method for HDSM generation; this was then named the hyperspectral VLL (HVLL) approach. Additionally, image classification was introduced into the processing chain in order to adapt the matching parameters, based on different classes. We also proposed a method for extracting the spectral and viewing angle information of the points. An empirical study was carried out using UAV datasets from tropical and boreal forests using 2D format hyperspectral cameras, based on tuneable Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) technology. Quality assessment was performed using DSMs based on state-of-the-art commercial software and airborne laser scanning (ALS). The results showed that the proposed technique generated a high-quality HDSM in both tested environments. The HDSM had higher deviations over the continuous canopy cover than the digital surface models (DSMs) generated using commercial software.

Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation and forest degradation are the second largest source of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Even though the emissions vary from region to region, a significant amount of carbon emissions comes mostly from timber harvesting, which is tightly linked to the selective logging intensity. This study intended to utilize a remote sensing approach to quantify carbon emissions from selective logging activities in Ulu Jelai Forest Reserve, Pahang, Malaysia. To quantify the emissions, the relevant variables from the logging's impact were identified as a predictor in the model development and were listed as stump height, stump diameter, cross-sectional area, timber volume, logging gaps, road, skid trails, and incidental damage resulting from the logging process. The predictive performance of linear regression and machine learning models, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and K-nearest neighbor, were examined to assess the carbon emission from this degraded forest. To test the different methods, a combination of ground inventory plots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and satellite imagery were analyzed, and the performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and coefficient of correlation (R-2) were calculated. Among the four models tested, the machine learning model SVM provided the best accuracy with an RMSE of 21.10% and a bias of 0.23% with an adjusted R-2 of 0.80. Meanwhile, the linear model performed second with an RMSE of 22.14%, a bias of 0.72%, and an adjusted R-2 of 0.75.

Selected sites where logging was detected were physically visited in the field and inspected using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The results were analyzed through confusion matrices to determine the algorithms accuracy to detect illegal logging. Results: The study highlighted a significant relationship between NDVI change and logging activities on the ground. In areas with major NDVI changes (less than-500), the model accuracy was greater than 75 %. In addition, there is a significant relationship between logged areas and slope, and distance to roads.

We found drone-based aerial deployment using a small 4-unit system was nearly 5 times faster than a ground-based approach in a heavily invaded lowland tropical forest setting and produced a statistically larger inoculation success rate one year after deployment, likely due to more central and higher placement within the targeted canopies. We found aerial imagery to be a useful tool to determine inoculation success and quantify spatiotemporal spread.

Kellner",Scientific Reports,2021,10.1038/s41598-021-90576-x,"Field measurements demonstrate a carbon sink in the Amazon and Congo basins, but the cause of this sink is uncertain. One possibility is that forest landscapes are experiencing transient recovery from previous disturbance. Attributing the carbon sink to transient recovery or other processes is challenging because we do not understand the sensitivity of conventional remote sensing methods to changes in aboveground carbon density (ACD) caused by disturbance events. Here we use ultra-high-density drone lidar to quantify the impact of a blowdown disturbance on ACD in a lowland rain forest in Costa Rica. We show that the blowdown decreased ACD by at least 17.6%, increased the number of canopy gaps, and altered the gap size-frequency distribution.

For various species of Chagas disease vectors, there is evidence that change in land use affects population density and abundance. Triatoma dimidiata is the most important Chagas vector in Guatemala, and at least one million people live in T. dimidiata endemic areas; however, infestation dynamics vary among regions, from high infestation with all life stages to low seasonal infestation by sylvatic adults. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate how land-use, combined with domiciliary risk factors, influences the infestation dynamics of T. dimidiata for four villages in a dry forest region with a strong deforestation history. METHODS Land use, measured with drone and satellite images, was classified into four categories (houses, monocultures and pastures, woodland and shrubland, and bare soil). Domiciliary risk factors and infestation were assessed through entomological surveys. Statistical analyses compared infestation indices and the ability of land use and domiciliary risk factors to explain infestation. FINDINGS Two villages had significantly higher infestation (26 and 30% vs. 5 and 6%), yet all villages had high colonisation (71-100% of infested houses had immature insects), with no significant difference among them. Because of the high level of deforestation across the study area, land use was not related to infestation; however, domiciliary risk factors were. A model based on four weighted domiciliary risk factors (adobe or bajareque walls, intradomicile animals, intradomicile clutter, and dirt floors) explains the infestation risk.

Current anthropogenic stressors threaten these ecosystems and urge researchers to create improved monitoring methods for better environmental management. Recent efforts that have focused on automatically quantifying the above-ground biomass using image analysis have found some success on high resolution imagery of mangrove forests that have sparse vegetation. In this study, we focus on stands of mangrove forests with dense vegetation consisting of the endemic Pelliciera rhizophorae and the more widespread Rhizophora mangle mangrove species located in the remote Utria National Park in the Colombian Pacific coast. Our developed workflow used consumer-grade Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS) imagery of the mangrove forests, from which large orthophoto mosaics and digital surface models are built. We apply convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for instance segmentation to accurately delineate (33% instance average precision) individual tree canopies for the Pelliciera rhizophorae species. We also apply CNNs for semantic segmentation to accurately identify (97% precision and 87% recall) the area coverage of the Rhizophora mangle mangrove tree species as well as the area coverage of surrounding mud and water land-cover classes. We provide a novel algorithm for merging predicted instance segmentation tiles of trees to recover tree shapes and sizes in overlapping border regions of tiles. Using the automatically segmented ground areas we interpolate their height from the digital surface model to generate a digital elevation model, significantly reducing the effort for ground pixel selection. Finally, we calculate a canopy height model from the digital surface and elevation models and combine it with the inventory of Pelliciera rhizophorae trees to derive the height of each individual mangrove tree. The resulting inventory of a mangrove forest, with individual P. rhizophorae tree height information, as well as crown shape and size descriptions, enables the use of allometric equations to calculate important monitoring metrics, such as above-ground biomass and carbon stocks.",Colombia,Germany,Wet tropical,Mangrove,"Utría National Park (La Chunga North, Terron Colorado, Estero Grande Shore)","6.018037751642747, -77.34591719163333",from study,"6.018038, -77.345917",Multi-rotor,"DJI Phantom 4, DJI Mavic Pro",RGB,"DJI FC330, DJI FC220","3.64 cm/px, 3.27 cm/px, 5.83 cm/px",.0425 m,not reported,,Mangrove sites with tree-level mapping,no,Single campaign (Feb 2019),Single campaign,Mangrove survey (date not specified),not reported,Tree Count; Canopy Height Model; Canopy Cover; Biomass Estimation,GNSS,Forest structure/dynamics,To develop a workflow for mapping and counting individual mangrove trees and calculating above-ground biomass using UAV imagery and CNNs,"Deep learning networks successfully delineated individual trees (33% AP) and mapped mangrove cover (97% precision, 87% recall).",Provided high-resolution orthomosaics and DSMs for training deep learning instance and semantic segmentation models.,not reported,https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.956799,GitHub: dschuerholz/mangrove_instance_segmentation

In particular, consistent methods for detecting subtle changes in the forest canopy structure caused by selective logging are lacking. Here, using a unique dataset collected in southeastern Cameroon, covering over 22,000 ha of monthly harvesting areas, >6000 locations of harvested trees, and an independent canopy gap dataset developed from an uninhabited aerial vehicle flight (UAV; RGB camera) of approximately 1500 ha, a new method was designed to monitor canopy disturbance and logging intensity in Central Africa. Using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, the method was conceptualised using a two-step, two-scale approach, which better matched logging practices. First, (non-)harvesting activity areas were identified using textural indices at a spatial resolution of 300 m (step 1), and within these harvesting activity areas, canopy gaps were detected at a resolution of 10 m (step 2). Both steps were based on monthly differences in the Sentinel-1 SAR time series computed using the average of the 12 months preceding and the average of the three months following the month of interest. This method identified harvesting activity areas (step 1 at 300 m resolution) of over 12,004 km(2) with high accuracy (omission and commission errors for both classes <= 0.05) and, within them, detected canopy gaps (step 2 at 10 m resolution) with a global accuracy of 0.89. Although some canopy gaps were subject to omission and commission errors (0.39 and 0.05, respectively), this method yielded better results than other available approaches. Compared to the UAV canopy gaps, this method detected most of the small gaps (<= 500 m(2)), which represent 80% of all disturbed areas, whereas other available approaches missed at least 70% of these and consequently missed most of the disturbance events occurring in a selectively logged forest. Furthermore, the predictions were correlated with logging intensity, i.e., the number of trees and volume cut per hectare, which are two important criteria for assessing the sustainability of logging activities.

However, so-defined ""degraded forests"" may widely vary in terms of recoverability. A prolonged loss of recoverability, commonly described as a loss of resilience, poses a true threat to global environments. In Bornean logged-over forests, dense thickets of ferns and vines have been observed to cause arrested secondary succession, and their area may indicate the extent of slow biomass recovery. Therefore, we aimed to discriminate the fern thickets and vine-laden forests from those logged-over forests without dense ferns and vines, as well as mapping their distributions, with the aid of Landsat-8 satellite imagery and machine learning modeling. During the process, we tested whether the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures of Landsat data and Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data were helpful for this classification. Our study sites were Deramakot and Tangkulap Forest Reserves-commercial production forests in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. First, we flew drones and obtained aerial images that were used as ground truth for the supervised classification. Subsequently, a machine-learning model with a gradient-boosting decision tree was iteratively tested in order to derive the best model for the classification of the vegetation. Finally, the best model was extrapolated to the entire forest reserve and used to map three classes of vegetation (fern thickets, vine-laden forests, and logged-over forests without ferns and vines) and two non-vegetation classes (bare soil and open water). The overall classification accuracy of the best model was 86.6%; however, by combining the fern and vine classes into the same category, the accuracy was improved to 91.5%. The GLCM texture variables were especially effective at separating fern/vine vegetation from the non-degraded forest, but the SAR data showed a limited effect. Our final vegetation map showed that 30.7% of the reserves were occupied by ferns or vines, which may lead to arrested succession.

Trees with lower wood density were less prone to die when their proportion of crown was more exposed to sunlight, but this relationship with relative crown exposure weakened and slightly reversed as wood density increased. Trees growing less than their species average had higher mortality, especially when the species' wood density decreased. The role of wood density in determining the survival of canopy trees under varying light conditions indicates differential responses of light-demanding versus shade-tolerant species.

This makes Indonesia one of the largest carbon sources worldwide. The study at hand, investigates monitoring of canopy height and above-ground biomass (AGB) from space in Indonesian tropical forests. Using data from 2015, the canopy height and AGB were modelled in Kalimantan based on quad-pol Pol-InSAR data from RADARSAT-2 (RS-2) and dual-pol Pol-InSAR data from TerraSAR-X (TS-X). Novel algorithms utilizing the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) interferometric model and the Random Motion over Ground (RMoG) interferometric model were tested to obtain a more accurate and robust forest parameter estimation during dry weather conditions. As a reference for modelling canopy height and AGB, extensive field inventory as well as LiDAR and drone data collected in Kalimantan were used. The RMoG model-based height inversion algorithm led to more accurate results for canopy height than the RVoG model. Using RS-2 imagery, the independent validation displayed a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.63 and a slight overestimation for the modelled canopy height. The modelled canopy height from TS-X data achieved an R-2 of up to 0.66 and resulted in underestimated modelled canopy height. The resulting AGB estimation based on the modelled canopy height resulted in an R-2 of 0.83 for RS-2 data and 0.84 for TS-X data. The results of the different tested images varied since the acquisition parameters and the weather conditions changed during acquisitions. It can be concluded, that not all RS-2 and TS-X data is suitable for modelling canopy height from coherence. The parameters that most affect the canopy height model were identified as the baselines (temporal and perpendicular), HoA (height of ambiguity), incident angle and moist weather conditions, as well as the wavelength. Ascending and descending flight directions did not display influence. Globally available high-resolution information about canopy height and AGB is important for carbon accounting.

High pulse density Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) holds promise to provide spatially resolved and accurate estimates of plant area density (PAD) in forested landscapes, a key step in understanding forest functioning: phenology, carbon uptake, transpiration, radiative balance etc. Inconsistencies between different ALS sensors is a barrier to generating globally harmonised PAD estimates. The basic assumption on which PAD estimation is based is that light attenuation is proportional to vegetation area density. This study shows that the recorded extinction strongly depends on target detectability which is influenced by laser characteristics (power, sensitivity, wavelength). Three different airborne laser scanners were flown over a wet tropical forest at the Paracou research station in French Guiana. Different sensors, flight heights and transmitted power levels were compared. Light attenuation was retrieved with an open source ray-tracing code (http://amapvox.org). Direct comparison revealed marked differences (upto 25% difference in profile-averaged light attenuation rate and 50% difference at particular heights) that could only be explained by differences in scanner characteristics. We show how bias which may occur under various acquisition conditions can generally be mitigated by a sensor intercalibration. Alignment of light weight lidar attenuation profiles to ALS reference attenuation profiles is not always satisfactory and we discuss what are the likely sources of discrepancies. Neglecting the dependency of apparent light attenuation on scanner properties may lead to biases in estimated vegetation density commensurate to those affecting light attenuation estimates.

This narrative, however, is mostly based on research within primary production regions. Though space-borne remote sensing applications can be useful in monitoring such large-scale production modes, environmental effects of household-level production are less easy to assess. Therefore, the present study employs an unmanned aerial system (UAS) to assess the impact of small-scale charcoal production on the vegetation density in the immediate vicinity of production sites. The UAS data was complemented by field measurements and very high-resolution WordView-2 satellite imagery. This approach revealed only small differences between charcoal production sites and reference plots which were usually evened out after 20-25-m distance to the plot centre using a concentric ring analysis.

Monitoring land cover change through remote sensing has become the best solution, especially with the use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs; drones) as low-cost remote sensing platforms are able to collect data at high spatial and spectral resolutions. Unfortunately, in the context of climate change studies, the lack of comparative UAS data sets over decadal timescales has been limiting.

This study assessed the influence of image resolution, camera type and side overlap on prediction accuracy of biomass models constructed from ground-based data and UAS data in miombo woodlands in Malawi. We compared prediction accuracy of models reflecting two different image resolutions (10 and 15 cm ground sampling distance) and two camera types (NIR and RGB). The effect of two different side overlap levels (70 and 80%) was also assessed using data from the RGB camera. Multiple linear regression models that related the biomass on 37 field plots to several independent 3-dimensional variables derived from five UAS acquisitions were constructed. Prediction accuracy quantified by leave-one-out cross validation increased when using finer image resolution and RGB camera, while coarser resolution and NIR data decreased model prediction accuracy, although no significant differences were observed in absolute prediction error around the mean between models. The results showed that a reduction of side overlap from 80 to 70%, while keeping a fixed forward overlap of 90%, might be an option for reducing flight time and cost of acquisitions.

To do so, eight flights were carried out with a Phantom 4, with two flight planning applications (Litchi and Pix4Dcapture) and two flight arrangements (single and double), totaling four flights for each application. All flights were processed using the Pix4Dmapper program. The LiDAR database was obtained with a DJI Matrice 300 system and from this data, the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of the area was extracted. From the UAV data, the Digital Surface Model (DSM) of each flight was obtained. Subtracting each DSM from the DTM resulted in the CHMs for each UAV flight flown. The CHMs were smoothed with the CHMsmoothing function and three search window sizes were tested (6.5 x 6.5, 8 x 8, and 10 x 10). Results: The results of the ITD approach revealed that in unsmoothed and smoothed CHMs, the search window of size 8 resulted in the best precision metrics, with the highest recall, precision, and F-score values. In the smallest window size, there was the highest number of false positives while in the largest window size, the omitted trees were more representative.

Vegetation structural metrics were measured with UAV-LiDAR at 10 m resolution for a 25 km2 study area. Because bats frequently moved outside the study area, we also characterized vegetation height and horizontal complexity over the full extent of bat movement trajectories by upscaling UAV-LiDAR measurements using primarily GEDI LiDAR data.ResultsAt the site level, hammer-headed bats preferred areas of intermediate canopy height (13.9-32.0 m) close to large canopy gaps (>= 500 m2). Individual bats varied in selection for vertical vegetation complexity, distance to smaller canopy gaps (>= 50 m2) and plant volume density of intermediate vegetation strata (10-20 m). Over the full extent of movement trajectories, hammer-headed bats consistently preferred intermediate canopy height, and areas closer to canopy gaps. At both spatial extents, bats moved the shortest distances in swamp habitats dominated by Raphia palms. These behaviors indicate the use of forest types that vary structurally, with a preference for open airspace during foraging or moving among resources, and for dense swamp vegetation during roosting and resting periods. In addition, most bats regularly made long flights of up to 17.7 km shortly after sunset and before sunrise and limited their movements to three or fewer destinations throughout the tracking period.ConclusionsThese results highlight the importance of structurally diverse landscapes for the nightly movements of hammer-headed bats.

We aimed to assess whether Geoffroy's spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) could be detected in RGB videos collected by drones in tropical forests. We performed 77 pre-programmed grid flights with a DJI Mavic 2 Pro drone at a height of 10 m above the maximum canopy height covering 45% of a 1-hectare polygon per flight.

Proportion of spider monkey detections during drone flights was lower than other commonly employed survey methods. Agreement between video-coders was high.

Structure-from-Motion (SfM) Digital Aerial Photogrammetry (SfM-DAP), which relies on photographs taken of the same area from multiple angles, is a lower-cost alternative to LiDAR for generating 3D data on forest structure. Here, we evaluate how SfM-DAP compares to LiDAR data acquired concurrently using a fixed-wing UAV, over two contrasting tropical forests in Gabon and Peru. We show that SfM-DAP data cannot be used in isolation to measure key aspects of forest structure, including canopy height (%Bias: 40%-50%), fractional cover, and gap fraction, due to difficulties measuring ground elevation, even under low tree cover. However, we find even in complex forests, SfM-DAP is an effective means of measuring top-of-canopy structure, including surface heterogeneity, and is capable of producing similar measurements of vertical structure as LiDAR. Thus, in areas where ground height is known, SfM-DAP is an effective method for measuring important aspects of forest structure, including canopy height, and gaps, however, without ground data, SfM-DAP is of more limited utility.

Lianas (woody vines) are important tropical forest components, most conspicuous in the canopy. Lianas reduce forest carbon uptake and their recent increase may, therefore, limit forest carbon storage with global consequences for climate change. Liana infestation of tree crowns is traditionally assessed from the ground, which is labour intensive and difficult, particularly for upper canopy layers. We used a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to assess liana infestation of tree canopies from above. It was a commercially available quadcopter UAV with an integrated, standard three-waveband camera to collect aerial image data for 150 ha of tropical forest canopy. By visually interpreting the images, we assessed the degree of liana infestation for 14.15 ha of forest for which ground-based estimates were collected simultaneously. We compared the UAV liana infestation estimates with those from the ground to determine the validity, strengths, and weaknesses of using UAVs as a new method for assessing liana infestation of tree canopies. Estimates of liana infestation from the UAV correlated strongly with ground-based surveys at individual tree and plot level, and across multiple forest types and spatial resolutions, improving liana infestation assessment for upper canopy layers. Importantly, UAV-based surveys, including the image collection, processing, and visual interpretation, were considerably faster and more cost-efficient than ground-based surveys. Synthesis and applications. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image data of tree canopies can be easily captured and used to assess liana infestation at least as accurately as traditional ground data. This novel method promotes reproducibility of results and quality control, and enables additional variables to be derived from the image data. It is more cost-effective, time-efficient and covers larger geographical extents than traditional ground surveys, enabling more comprehensive monitoring of changes in liana infestation over space and time. This is important for assessing liana impacts on the global carbon balance, and particularly useful for forest management where knowledge of the location and change in liana infestation can be used for tailored, targeted, and effective management of tropical forests for enhanced carbon sequestration (e.g., REDD+ projects), timber concessions, and forest restoration.",Malaysia,UK,Moist tropical,Forest,Danum Valley Conservation Area and Sepilok Forest Reserve,"4°57′N, 117°42′E ; 5°52′N, 117°56′E",from study,"4.950000, 117.700000; 5.866667, 117.933333",Multi-rotor,DJI Phantom 3 Advanced,RGB,Sony EXMOR 1/2.3″ 12-megapixel camera,"10 mm/pixel, 20 mm/pixel",.015 m,14.15 ha,14.15 ha,150 ha and 50 ha area of forest were used for the study.,no,May and June 2016,1 scan,Single flight of 23 min duration,30 and 60 m,Canopy Cover,,Forest structure/dynamics,To estimate Liana infestation of tree crowns using UAV,Liana infestaion of tree crowns were estimate using UAV image data,Used to capture the RGB data of canopy in the forest,Available in Supplementary Material,Available at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.21t1805,not reported

Terrestrial laser scanning cannot describe the canopy trees in a large area, and it is unclear whether unmanned aerial vehicle-light detection and ranging (UAV-LiDAR) data have the ability to capture the forest canopy structural parameters in tropical forests. In this study, we estimated five forest canopy structures (stand density (N), basic area (G), above-ground biomass (AGB), Lorey's mean height (HL), and under-crown height (hT)) with four modeling algorithms (linear regression (LR), bagged tree (BT), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF)) based on UAV-LiDAR data and 60 sample plot data from tropical forests in Hainan and determined the optimal algorithms for the five canopy structures by comparing the performance of the four algorithms. First, we defined the canopy tree as a tree with a height >= 70% HL. Then, UAV-LiDAR metrics were calculated, and the LiDAR metrics were screened by recursive feature elimination (RFE). Finally, a prediction model of the five forest canopy structural parameters was established by the four algorithms, and the results were compared. The metrics' screening results show that the most important LiDAR indexes for estimating HL, AGB, and hT are the leaf area index and some height metrics, while the most important indexes for estimating N and G are the kurtosis of heights and the coefficient of variation of height. The relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) of five structure parameters showed the following: when modeling HL, the rRMSEs (10.60%-12.05%) obtained by the four algorithms showed little difference; when N was modeled, BT, RF, and SVR had lower rRMSEs (26.76%-27.44%); when G was modeled, the rRMSEs of RF and SVR (15.37%-15.87%) were lower; when hT was modeled, BT, RF, and SVR had lower rRMSEs (10.24%-11.07%); when AGB was modeled, RF had the lowest rRMSE (26.75%).

However, if partnered with international funders, such projects often require robust and transparent aboveground carbon measurements to secure payments, and current monitoring approaches are not necessarily appropriate due to costs, scale, and complexity. The use of consumer-grade drones in combination with open source structure-from-motion photogrammetry may provide a solution. In this study, we tested the suitability of a simplified drone-based method for measuring aboveground carbon density in heavily degraded tropical forests at a 2 ha restoration site in Sabah, Malaysia, comparing our results against established field-based methods. We used structure-from-motion photogrammetry to generate canopy height models from drone imagery, and applied multiple pre-published plot-aggregate allometric equations to examine the importance of utilising regionally calibrated allometric equations. Our results suggest that this simplified method can produce aboveground carbon density measurements of a similar magnitude to field-based methods, quickly and only with a single input metric. However, there are greater levels of uncertainty in carbon density measurements due to errors associated with canopy height measurements from drones. Our findings also highlight the importance of selecting regionally calibrated allometric equations for this approach.

Three-dimensional models of tropical rainforest canopies can be constructed from overlapping photos using Structure from Motion (SfM), but it is often impossible to map the ground elevation directly from such data because canopy gaps are rare in rainforests. Without knowledge of the terrain elevation, it is, thus, difficult to accurately measure the canopy height or forest properties, including the recovery stage and aboveground carbon density. Working in an Indonesian ecosystem restoration landscape, we assessed how well SfM derived the estimates of the canopy height and aboveground carbon density compared with those from an airborne laser scanning (also known as LiDAR) benchmark. SfM systematically underestimated the canopy height with a mean bias of approximately 5 m. The linear models suggested that the bias increased quadratically with the top-of-canopy height for short, even-aged, stands but linearly for tall, structurally complex canopies (>10 m). The predictions based on the simple linear model were closely correlated to the field-measured heights when the approach was applied to an independent survey in a different location (R2 = 67% and RMSE = 1.85 m), but a negative bias of 0.89 m remained, suggesting the need to refine the model parameters with additional training data. Models that included the metrics of canopy complexity were less biased but with a reduced R2. The inclusion of ground control points (GCPs) was found to be important in accurately registering SfM measurements in space, which is essential if the survey requirement is to produce small-scale restoration interventions or to track changes through time. However, at the scale of several hectares, the top-of-canopy height and above-ground carbon density estimates from SfM and LiDAR were very similar even without GCPs.

This research fills a knowledge gap about the viability and dissimilarities of using these technologies for measuring the top of canopy structure in tropical forests. In an empirical study with data acquired in a Guyanese tropical forest, we assessed the differences between top of canopy models (TCMs) derived from TLS measurements and from UAV imagery, processed using structure from motion. Firstly, canopy gaps lead to differences in TCMs derived from TLS and UAVs. UAV TCMs overestimate canopy height in gap areas and often fail to represent smaller gaps altogether. Secondly, it was demonstrated that forest change caused by logging can be detected by both TLS and UAV TCMs, although it is better depicted by the TLS. Thirdly, this research shows that both TLS and UAVTCMs are sensitive to the small variations in sensor positions during data collection. TCMs rendered from UAV data acquired over the same area at different moments are more similar (RMSE 0.11-0.63 m for tree height, and 0.14-3.05 m for gap areas) than those rendered from TLS data (RMSE 0.21-1.21 m for trees, and 1.02-2.48 m for gaps).

Most climate models are at the macroscale, operating at a similar to 1 km resolution and predicting future temperatures at 1.5-2 m above ground level, making them unable to predict microclimates at the scale that many organisms experience temperature. We studied the effects of forest structure and vertical position on microclimatic air temperature within forest canopy in a historically degraded tropical forest in Sikundur, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia. We collected temperature measurements in fifteen plots over 20 months, alongside vegetation structure data from the same fifteen 25 x 25 m plots. We also performed airborne surveys using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to record canopy structure remotely, both over the plot locations and a wider area. We hypothesised that old-growth forest structure would moderate microclimatic air temperature. Our data showed that Sikundur is a thermally dynamic environment, with simultaneously recorded temperatures at different locations within the canopy varying by up to similar to 15 degrees C. Our models (R-2 = 0.90 to 0.95) showed that temperature differences between data loggers at different sites were largely determined by variation in recording height and the amount of solar radiation reaching the topmost part of the canopy, although strong interactions between these abiotic factors and canopy structure shaped microclimate air temperature variation.

Tree height can be used as an important predictor of forest growth, and yield models can provide basic data for forest degradation assessments. As an important parameter of unmanned aerial vehicle-light detection and ranging (UAV-LiDAR), it is not clear how the point cloud density affects the extraction accuracy of tree height in degraded tropical rain forests. To solve this problem, we collected UAV-LiDAR data at a flight altitude of 150 m, and then resampled the UAV-LiDAR data obtained according to the point cloud density percentage resampling method and obtained UAV-LiDAR data for five different point cloud densities, namely, 12, 17, 28, 64, and 108 points/m(2). On the basis of the resampled LiDAR data, we generated a canopy height model (CHM) to extract the height of Dacrydium pierrei (D. pierrei). The results show that (1) With the increase in the point cloud density, the accuracy of tree height extraction gradually increased, with a maximum accuracy at 108 points/m(2) (root mean squared error (RMSE)% = 22.78%, bias% = 14.86%). The accuracy (RMSE%) increased by 6.92% as the point cloud density increased from 12 points/m(2) to 17 points/m(2), but only increased by 0.99% as the point cloud density increased from 17 points/m(2) to 108 points/m(2), indicating that 17 points/m(2) is a critical point for tree height extraction of D. pierrei.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are auto-piloted aircraft that can be used to map areas aerially using high resolution photography. Previously detectable through expensive helicopter surveys, this study sought to provide a new and less expensive method for the detection of estuarine crocodile nests in tropical forest ecosystems, as well as to propose additional applications of the technology based on field performance levels. The use of drones to detect crocodile nests is the first such application of the technology. We successfully identified two crocodile nests during the course of five flight hours (1550 ha; 15.5 km(2)) of testing along the Kinabatangan River in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, confirming the feasibility of the technology. We located these nests in close proximity to oil palm plantations, suggesting that low-level disturbance does not provide an obstacle to successful nesting. The potential to identify nests within unprotected forest could lead to additional protected areas being listed, and the effective management of crocodile nesting habitat will also provide benefits for many additional species within the ecosystem.

Traditional plot-based ground surveys have limitations in detecting and mapping emergent trees across a landscape, especially in dense tropical forests. In this study, a method is developed to detect emergent trees in a tropical rainforest in Sumatra, Indonesia, using a photogrammetric point cloud derived from RGB images collected using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). If a treetop, identified as a local maximum in a Digital Surface Model generated from the point cloud, was higher than the surrounding treetops (Trees_EM), and its crown was exposed above its neighbours (Trees_SL; assessed using slope and circularity measures), it was identified as an emergent tree, which might therefore be selected preferentially as a sleeping tree by hylobatids. A total of 54 out of 63 trees were classified as emergent by the developed algorithm and in the field.

Field- or LiDAR-based approaches enable reliable measurements of the structure and above-ground biomass (AGB) of tropical forests. Data derived from digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform offer several advantages over field- and LiDAR-based approaches in terms of scale and efficiency, and DAP has been presented as a viable and economical alternative in boreal or deciduous forests. However, detecting with DAP the ground in dense tropical forests, which is required for the estimation of canopy height, is currently considered highly challenging. To address this issue, we present a generally applicable method that is based on machine learning methods to identify the forest floor in DAP-derived point clouds of dense tropical forests. We capitalize on the DAP-derived high-resolution vertical forest structure to inform ground detection. We conducted UAV-DAP surveys combined with field inventories in the tropical forest of the Congo Basin. Using airborne LiDAR (ALS) for ground truthing, we present a canopy height model (CHM) generation workflow that constitutes the detection, classification and interpolation of ground points using a combination of local minima filters, supervised machine learning algorithms and TIN densification for classifying ground points using spectral and geometrical features from the UAV-based 3D data. We demonstrate that our DAP-based method provides estimates of tree heights that are identical to LiDAR-based approaches (conservatively estimated NSE = 0.88, RMSE = 1.6 m).

The emergence of laser scanning, such as Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle Laser Scanning (UAV-LS), has advanced accurate and detailed forest structural measurements. TLS generally provides very accurate measurements on the plot-scale (a few ha), whereas UAV-LS provides comparable measurements on the landscape-scale ( 10 ha). Despite the pivotal role dense tropical forests play in our climate, the strengths and limitations of TLS and UAV-LS to accurately measure structural metrics in these forests remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose to combine TLS and UAV-LS data from dense tropical forest plots to analyse how this fusion can further advance 3D structural mapping of structurally complex forests. We compared stand (vertical point distribution profiles) and tree level metrics from TLS, UAV-LS as well as their fused point cloud. The tree level metrics included the diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), crown projection area (CPA), and crown volume (CV). Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of point density and number of returns for UAV-LS data acquisition. DBH measurements from TLS and UAV-LS were compared to census data. The TLS and UAV-LS based H, CPA and CV measurements were compared to those obtained from the fused point cloud. Our results for two tropical rainforest plots in Australia demonstrate that TLS can measure H, CPA and CV with an accuracy (RMSE) of 0.30 m (H-average =27.32 m), 3.06 m(2) (CPAaverage =66.74 m(2)), and 29.63 m(3) (CVaverage =318.81 m(3)) respectively. UAV-LS measures H, CPA and CV with an accuracy (RMSE) of <0.40 m, <5.50 m(2), and <30.33 m(3) respectively. However, in dense tropical forests single flight UAV-LS is unable to sample the tree stems sufficiently for DBH measurement due to a limited penetration of the canopy. TLS can determine DBH with an accuracy (RMSE) of 5.04 cm, (DBHaverage =45.08 cm), whereas UAV-LS can not. We show that in dense tropical forests stand-alone TLS is able to measure macroscopic structural tree metrics on plot-scale. We also show that UAV-LS can be used to quickly measure H, CPA, and CV of canopy trees on the landscape-scale with comparable accuracy to TLS. Hence, the fusion of TLS and UAV-LS, which can be time consuming and expensive, is not required for these purposes.

Measuring thermal habitat quality is either limited to small spatial extents, such as with ground-based 3D operative temperature (Te) replicas, representing the temperature of the animal at equilibrium with its environment, or is based on microclimate derived from physical models that use land cover variables and downscale coarse climate data. We draw on aspects of both these approaches and test the ability of unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) data (optical RGB) to predict fine-scale heterogeneity in sub-canopy lizard (Anolis bicaorum) Te in tropical forest using random forest models. Anolis bicaorum is an endemic, critically endangered, species, facing significant threats of habitat loss and degradation, and work was conducted as part of a larger project. Our findings indicate that a model incorporating solely air temperature, measured at the centre of the 20 x 20 m plot, and ground-based leaf area index (LAI) measurements, measured at directly above the 3D replica, predicted Te well. However, a model with air temperature and UAV-derived canopy metrics performed slightly better with the added advantage of enabling the mapping of Te with continuous spatial extent at high spatial resolutions, across the whole of the UAV orthomosaic, allowing us to capture and map Te across the whole of the survey plot, rather than purely at 3D replica locations. Our work provides a feasible workflow to map sub-canopy lizard Te in tropical environments at spatial scales relevant to the organism, and across continuous areas. This can be applied to other species and can represent species within the same community that have evolved a similar thermal niche. Such methods will be imperative in risk modelling of such species to anthropogenic land cover and climate change. This study outlines a new workflow, using UAVs, to map lizard operative temperatures across landscapes at organism-relevant spatial resolutions, which until now was not possible. This workflow allows us to measure thermal suitability and heterogeneity across continuous landscapes, which is crucial to inform conservation actions for ectothermic species. Here, we use random forest models to couple UAV-derived canopy measures (texture and greenness) from RGB imagery, with sub-canopy thermal 3D replicas, to predict lizard operative temperature at solar noon. This workflow was found to work well across forest, mangrove and urban environments and allows us to measure thermal suitability across whole areas, rather than solely point-based measures from standard thermal 3D replica methods.

However, standardised procedures for campaign planning are still largely missing. This study investigated scanner properties and flight planning to provide recommendations on minimising forest canopy occlusion and thereby maximise exploration of canopy volume. A flight campaign involving two UAV-LS systems was conducted over a dense, wet tropical forest at the Paracou research station (French Guiana). Four experiments on scanner properties and flight planning were conducted, analysed and recommendations derived. First, the scanner pulse repetition rate (PRR) should be at least 100 kHz per 1 m s-1flight speed based on 360 degrees FOV for exploration of middle canopy strata (5 m to 20 m). Higher PRR are beneficial for exploration of lower canopy (<5 m) but would need to be increased exponentially to achieve linear improvement. Alternatively, flight speed could be reduced within the constraints given by the inertial measurement unit (IMU), but would increase flight time. Second, the scanner maximum range was identified as a proxy for the laser pulse power, which positively impacts canopy exploration. This was particularly the case when using multi-return capabilities. No saturation could be observed when increasing the laser power, suggesting that this is currently a limiting factor. Additionally, a smaller laser beam divergence and pulse width were plausible reasons for better exploration of the upper canopy just below the top of canopy. Third, off-nadir scanning angles up to 20 degrees were found to result in similar occlusions, suggesting a practical FOV of 40 degrees in the investigated dense forest. This number might be larger for open canopies. UAV-LS systems with viewing geometries that focus laser pulses downwards and within optimal ranges should be preferred. Fourth, using different horizontal flight directions in the mission planning favours minimisation of occlusion. A minimum of two different flight directions is suggested. However, specific optimal yaw angles were not possible to predict before flight. Therefore, including multiple directions ensures coverage of all possible configurations. Many of these investigated features can be optimised independently from each other, and should be considered before acquisition of new UAV-LS systems and flight mission planning.

One of the most commonly used assessment methods is a field survey. However, this approach is extremely challenging for obtaining highly accurate estimates in forests with tall and dense canopies. In this study, we utilized airborne remotely sensed mean canopy height (MCH) spatial coverage acquired by high-cost airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) and low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensors to quantify the tree height for a 590-ha complex tropical forest in the mountainous region of central Taiwan. The performances of the acquisition techniques were evaluated by comparing the statistical relationships of MCH from lidar and MCH from UAV with the concurrently obtained field mean tree height measurement (MTH) at the plot (25 × 20 m) scale. In addition, we further analyzed the forest structural variables that may influence lidar and UAV MCHs by using a general linear model. The results showed that both MCHs derived from lidar and UAV accurately estimated MTH. MCH from UAV had a superior performance to that of a small model offset, and the slope of the model fit line was close to one, which was possibly due to the finer spatial resolution of the UAV imagery.

Current field observations across the Neotropics suggest that liana abundance is rising as a result of forest disturbance, increasing atmospheric CO2, and more frequent extreme climate events. Lianas can cause mechanical stress on their host trees, thus increasing mortality, in addition to potentially reducing carbon storage capacity. Furthermore, previous studies have suggested that liana leaves have an overall higher temperature than tree leaves, which presents the question of whether these differences can be extended from the leaf to the canopy. In this context, the ability to detect these temperature differences from a remote sensing platform has so far not been put into test, despite the importance such knowledge can have in large-scale land surface modeling studies and liana extent monitoring. To partially fill this knowledge gap, we acquired thermal infrared data using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system over an intermediate tropical dry forest in Costa Rica, Central America. Classification results from a previous study in the same area were used to subset the thermal infrared images into liana-infested areas, non-liana infested areas, and forest gaps. The temperature differences between these three image components were then investigated using the Welch and Games–Howell post-hoc statistical tests. Our results suggest that liana-infested areas have, on average, a statistically significant higher temperature than non-liana infested areas. Shadowed forest gaps, used as reference, have a cooler temperature than forest canopies.

Analysing how and why lianas are distributed in forest canopies at landscape scales will help us determine the mechanisms driving changes in lianas over time. This will improve our understanding of liana ecology and projections of tropical forest carbon storage now and into the future. Despite competing hypotheses on the mechanisms driving spatial patterning of lianas, few studies have integrated multiple tree-level biotic and abiotic factors in an analytical framework. None have done so in the Palaeotropics, which are biogeographically and evolutionarily distinct from the Neotropics, where most research on lianas has been conducted. We used an unoccupied aerial system (UAS; drone) to assess liana load in 50-ha of Palaeotropical forest canopy in Southeast Asia. We obtained data on hypothesised drivers of liana spatial distribution in the forest canopy, including disturbance, tree characteristics, soil chemistry and topography, from the UAS, from airborne LiDAR and from ground surveys. We integrated these in a comprehensive analytical framework to extract variables at an individual-tree level and evaluated the relative strengths of the hypothesised drivers and their ability to predict liana distributions through boosted regression tree (BRT) modelling. Tree height and distance to canopy gaps were the two most important predictors of liana load, with relative contribution values in BRT models of 34.60%–45.39% and 7.93%–10.19%, respectively. Our results suggest that taller trees were less often and less heavily infested by lianas than shorter trees, opposite to Neotropical findings. Lianas also occurred more often, and to a greater extent, in tree crowns close to canopy gaps and to neighbouring trees with lianas in their crown. Synthesis. Despite their known importance and prevalence in tropical forests, lianas are not well understood, particularly in the Palaeotropics. Examining 2428 trees across 50-ha of Palaeotropical forest canopy in Southeast Asia, we find support for the hypothesis that canopy gaps promote liana infestation. However, we also found that liana presence and load declined with tree height, which is opposite to well-established Neotropical findings. This suggests a fundamental difference between Neotropical and Southeast Asian forests.

Hyperspectral remote sensing has emerged as a significant data source for digital soil mapping. However, in ecosystems with dense canopy cover, optical sensors face challenges in directly capturing soil surface spectra due to canopy obstruction. Consequently, estimating SOC in forest ecosystems remains a difficult task. LiDAR can capture forest structural attributes and soil surface information, providing possibility for SOC estimation in forest ecosystems. To date, the potential of LiDAR data in forest SOC estimation has not been fully explored. Here, we conducted SOC investigations in two tropical rainforests. Firstly, hyperspectral and LiDAR data were collected for the study areas using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms. Subsequently, 40 vegetation indices (VI) and 101 LiDAR-derived variables were extracted from the hyperspectral images and LiDAR data, respectively. Furthermore, the RRelieff algorithm was employed to select the most robust variables. Finally, a deep neural network (DNN) model was utilized to establish the relationship between these variables and measured SOC, and to map the spatial distribution of SOC in the rainforests. It stems from the results that carotenoid reflectance index 2 (CRI2), non-linear index (NLI), and carotenoid reflectance index 1 (CRI1) were the best VIs for forest SOC estimation. Among the LiDAR variables, canopy height model (CHM) and digital elevation model (DEM) were the most important for model building. The performance of SOC estimation model based solely on LiDAR features (R2 = 0.61) surpassed that of the model using only optical VI (R2 = 0.59).

UAV systems can generate high-resolution images that provide accurate information on forest ecosystems to aid decision-making in restoration projects. However, UAV technological advances have outpaced practical application; thus, we explored combining UAV-borne lidar and hyperspectral data to evaluate the diversity and structure of restoration plantings. We developed novel analytical approaches to assess twelve 13-year-old restoration plots experimentally established with 20, 60 or 120 native tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed (1) the congruence and complementarity of lidar and hyperspectral-derived variables, (2) their ability to distinguish tree richness levels and (3) their ability to predict aboveground biomass (AGB). We analyzed three structural attributes derived from lidar data—canopy height, leaf area index (LAI), and understory LAI—and eighteen variables derived from hyperspectral data—15 vegetation indices (VIs), two components of the minimum noise fraction (related to spectral composition) and the spectral angle (related to spectral variability). We found that VIs were positively correlated with LAI for low LAI values, but stabilized for LAI greater than 2 m2/m2. LAI and structural VIs increased with increasing species richness, and hyperspectral variability was significantly related to species richness. While lidar-derived canopy height better predicted AGB than hyperspectral-derived VIs, it was the fusion of UAV-borne hyperspectral and lidar data that allowed effective co-monitoring of both forest structural attributes and tree diversity in restoration plantings. Furthermore, considering lidar and hyperspectral data together more broadly supported the expectations of biodiversity theory, showing that diversity enhanced biomass capture and canopy functional attributes in restoration.

Most studies of this phenomenon have been carried out in arid and semi-arid grasslands. Therefore, studies in tropical regions, particularly savannas, which are composed of grassland and woodland mosaics, are needed. Our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of woody encroachment classification in the Brazilian Cerrado, a tropical savanna. We acquired dry and wet season unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images using RGB and multispectral cameras that were processed by the support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) classifiers. We also compared two validation methods: the orthomosaic and in situ methods. We targeted two native woody species: Baccharis retusa and Trembleya parviflora. Identification of these two species was statistically (p < 0.05) most accurate in the wet season RGB images classified by the RF algorithm, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.7%. Relating to validation assessments, the in situ method was more susceptible to underfitting scenarios, especially using an RF classifier. The OA was higher in grassland than in woodland formations. Our results show that woody encroachment classification in a tropical savanna is possible using UAV images and field surveys and is suggested to be conducted during the wet season. It is challenging to classify UAV images in highly diverse ecosystems such as the Cerrado; therefore, whenever possible, researchers should use multiple accuracy assessment methods. In the case of using in situ accuracy assessment, we suggest a minimum of 40 training samples per class and to use multiple classifiers (e.g., RF and DT).

These technologies offer high-resolution data that can significantly enhance evaluations of forest structure, condition, and disturbance severity. UAV sensors such as LiDAR and multispectral provide complementary information about forest attributes, capturing structural and spectral details, yet their integration for comprehensive forest assessment remains understudied. In this paper, we explored the potential of combining UAV LiDAR and multispectral data to assess the disturbance severity of a West African forest patch (Benin). We developed an integrated disturbance index (IDI) that fuses structural properties from LiDAR data and spectral characteristics from multispectral vegetation indices through principal component analysis (PCA). This allowed us to delineate low (> 0.65), medium (0.35–0.65), and high (< 0.35) forest disturbance levels. We applied the IDI to the 560-ha Ewe-Adakplame relict forest in Benin, West Africa, and achieved 95 % overall accuracy in disturbance detection, outperforming both LiDAR-only (80 %) and multispectral-only (75 %) approaches. The IDI revealed that 23 % of the forest area has experienced low disturbance, while 28 % and 49 % face medium and high disturbance levels, respectively. These findings indicate that more than three-quarters of this relict forest exhibits medium to high levels of disturbance, underscoring the urgent need for tailored conservation strategies to strengthen forest resilience. This method's ability to differentiate disturbance levels can inform resource allocation, prioritize conservation efforts, and guide the development of site-specific management plans.

While machine learning (ML) algorithms demonstrate superior predictability of soil properties over linear models, their practical and automated application for predicting soil properties using remote sensing data requires further assessment. Therefore, this study aims to integrate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)-based hyperspectral images and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) points to predict the soil properties indirectly in two tropical rainforest mountains (Diaoluo and Limu) in Hainan Province, China. A total of 175 features, including texture features, vegetation indices, and forest parameters, were extracted from two study sites. Six ML models, Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), were constructed to predict soil properties, including soil acidity (pH), total nitrogen (TN), soil organic carbon (SOC), and total phosphorus (TP). To enhance model performance, a Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) was introduced to obtain optimal model hyperparameters. The results showed that compared with the default parameter tuning method, BOA always improved models’ performances in predicting soil properties, achieving average R2 improvements of 202.93%, 121.48%, 8.90%, and 38.41% for soil pH, SOC, TN, and TP, respectively. In general, BOA effectively determined the complex interactions between hyperparameters and prediction features, leading to an improved model performance of ML methods compared to default parameter tuning models. The GBDT model generally outperformed other ML methods in predicting the soil pH and TN, while the XGBoost model achieved the highest prediction accuracy for SOC and TP.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) open up the possibility to capture high resolution thermal images of forest canopies at the leaf scale. However, a careful calibration procedure is required to convert the thermal images to absolute temperatures, in addition, at high spatial resolution, the complexity of forest canopies leads to challenges in stitching overlapping thermal images into an orthomosaic of the forest site. In this study, we present a novel flight planning approach in which the locations of ground temperature references are directly integrated in the flight plan. Six UAV flight campaigns were conducted over a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica. For each flight five different calibration methods were tested. The most accurate calibration was used to analyze the tree canopy temperature distributions of five tree species. From the distribution we correlated its mean, variance, 5th and 95th percentile against individual tree transpiration estimates derived from sapflow measurements. Our results show that the commonly applied calibration provided by the cameras manufacturer (factory calibration) and empirical line calibration were less accurate than the novel repeated empirical line calibration and the factory calibration including drift correction (MAE 3.5°C vs. MAE 1.5°C). We show that the orthomosaic is computable by directly estimating the thermal image orientation from the visible images during the structure from motion step. We found the 5th percentile of the canopy temperature distribution, corresponding to the shaded leaves within the canopy, to be a better predictor of tree transpiration than the mean canopy temperature (R2 0.85 vs. R2 0.60). Although these shaded leaves are not representative of the whole canopy, they may be the main transpiration site in the heat of the day.

To hold restoration efforts accountable and monitor their outcomes, traditional strategies for monitoring tree cover increase by field surveys are falling short, because they are labor-intensive and costly. Meanwhile remote sensing approaches have not been able to distinguish different forest types that result from utilizing different restoration approaches (conservation versus production focus). Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can observe forests` vertical and horizontal structural variation, which has the potential to distinguish forest types. In this study, we explored this potential of UAV-borne LiDAR to distinguish forest types in landscapes under restoration in southeastern Brazil by using a supervised classification method. The study area encompassed 150 forest plots with six forest types divided in two forest groups: conservation (remnant forests, natural regrowth, and active restoration plantings) and production (monoculture, mixed, and abandoned plantations) forests. UAV-borne LiDAR data was used to extract several Canopy Height Model (CHM), voxel, and point cloud statistic based metrics at a high resolution for analysis. Using a random forest classification model we could successfully classify conservation and production forests (90% accuracy). Classification of the entire set of six types was less accurate (62%) and the confusion matrix showed a divide between conservation and production types. Understory Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the variation in vegetation density in the upper half of the canopy were the most important classification metrics. In particular, LAI understory showed the most variation, and may help advance ecological understanding in restoration. The difference in classification success underlines the difficulty of distinguishing individual forest types that are very similar in management, regeneration dynamics, and structure.

Several direct and indirect methods of LAI estimation have been developed and compared; however, many of these methods are prohibitively expensive and/or time consuming. Here, we examine the feasibility of using the free image processing software CAN-EYE to estimate effective plant area index (PAIeff) from hemispherical canopy images taken with an extremely inexpensive smartphone clip-on fisheye lens. We evaluate the effectiveness of this inexpensive method by comparing CAN-EYE smartphone PAIeff estimates to those from drone lidar over a lowland tropical forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We estimated PAIeff from drone lidar using a method based in radiative transfer theory that has been previously validated using simulated data; we consider this a conservative test of smartphone PAIeff reliability because above-canopy lidar estimates share few assumptions with understory image methods. Smartphone PAIeff varied from 0.1 to 4.4 throughout our study area and we found a significant correlation (r = 0.62, n = 42, p < 0.001) between smartphone and lidar PAIeff, which was robust to image processing analytical options and smartphone model. When old growth and secondary forests are assumed to have different leaf angle distributions for the lidar PAIeff algorithm (spherical and planophile, respectively) this relationship is further improved (r = 0.77, n = 42, p < 0.001). However, we found deviations in the magnitude of the PAIeff estimations depending on image analytical options.

However, tropical forest structure can vary dramatically within seemingly homogeneous landscapes due to subtle changes in topography, soil fertility, species composition and past disturbances. Although numerous studies have reported the effects of field-based stand structure attributes on aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests, the relative effects and contributions of UAV LiDAR-based canopy structure and ground-based stand structural attributes in shaping AGB remain unclear. Here, we hypothesize that mean top-of-canopy height (TCH) enhances AGB directly and indirectly via species richness and horizontal stand structural attributes, but these positive relationships are stronger at a larger spatial scale. We used a combined approach of field inventory and LiDAR-based remote sensing to explore how stand structural attributes (stem abundance, size variation and TCH) and tree species richness affect AGB along an elevational gradient in tropical forests at two spatial scales, i.e., 20 m × 20 m (small scale), and 50 m × 50 m (large scale) in southwest China. Specifically, we used structural equation models to test the proposed hypothesis. We found that TCH, stem size variation and abundance were strongly positively associated with AGB at both spatial scales, in addition to which increasing TCH led to greater AGB indirectly through increased stem size variation. Species richness had negative to negligible influences on AGB, but species richness increased with increasing stem abundance at both spatial scales. Our results suggest that light capture and use, modulated by stand structure, are key to promoting high AGB stocks in tropical forests. Thus, we argue that both horizontal and vertical stand structures are important for shaping AGB, but the relative contributions vary across spatial scales in tropical forests.

We used 5 years of approximately monthly drone-acquired RGB (red–green–blue) imagery for 50 ha of mature tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, to quantify spatial structure; temporal variation; and climate correlates of canopy disturbances, i.e., sudden and major drops in canopy height due to treefalls, branchfalls, or the collapse of standing dead trees. Canopy disturbance rates varied strongly over time and were higher in the wet season, even though wind speeds were lower in the wet season. The strongest correlate of monthly variation in canopy disturbance rates was the frequency of extreme rainfall events. The size distribution of canopy disturbances was best fit by a Weibull function and was close to a power function for sizes above 25 m2. Treefalls accounted for 74 % of the total area and 52 % of the total number of canopy disturbances in treefalls and branchfalls combined. We hypothesize that extremely high rainfall is a good predictor because it is an indicator of storms having high wind speeds, as well as saturated soils that increase uprooting risk. These results demonstrate the utility of repeat drone-acquired data for quantifying forest canopy disturbance rates at fine temporal and spatial resolutions over large areas, thereby enabling robust tests of how temporal variation in disturbance relates to climate drivers.

Some animal species can disperse seeds through multiple pathways (e.g., defecation, regurgitation, epizoochory), each likely producing distinct seed dispersal outcomes. We studied how seed traits (size and toughness) interact with disperser species to influence seed dispersal pathway and how this ultimately shapes the proportion of seeds deposited in various habitat types. We focused on three frugivorous species of duikers (African forest antelopes) in the Dja Faunal Reserve, a tropical rainforest in southern Cameroon. Duikers can both defecate and regurgitate seeds, the latter predominantly occurring during rumination at their bedding sites (or “nests”). We located duiker nests and dungs along 18 linear 1-km-transects to assess: (1) how seed traits affect the likelihood of dispersal via defecation versus regurgitation, (2) if defecated versus regurgitated seeds are deposited at different rates in different forest types (assessed by indigenous Baka), microhabitats, and forest structural attributes (measured by drone lidar), and (3) if these differ between three duiker species that vary in size and diel activity patterns. We found that duikers predominantly defecated small seeds (<3 mm length) and regurgitated larger and tougher seeds (>10 mm length), the latter including 25 different plant species. The three duiker species varied in their nesting habits, with nocturnal bay duikers (Cephalophus dorsalis) nesting in dense understory vegetation at proportions 3–4 times higher than Peter's and yellow-backed duikers (Cephalophus callipygus and Cephalophus silvicultor). As a result, bay duikers deposited larger regurgitated seeds at a higher rate in habitats with denser understory where lianas and palms predominate and near fallen trees.

They occupy part of the canopy, forming a layer of leaves overtopping tree crowns. Yet, their interaction with trees has been mainly studied from the ground. With the emergence of drone-based sensing, very high-resolution data may be obtained on liana distribution above canopies. Here, we assessed the relationship between common liana ground measurements and drone-determined liana leaf coverage over tree crowns, tested if this relationship is mediated by liana functional composition, and compared the signature of liana patches and tree crowns in our drone images. Using drone platforms, we acquired very high resolution RGB and multispectral images and LiDAR data over two 9-ha permanent plots located in northern Republic of Congo and delineated liana leaf coverage and individual tree crowns from these data. During a concomitant ground survey, we focused on 275 trees infested or not by lianas, for which we measured all lianas ≥ 1 cm in diameter climbing on them (n = 615) and estimated their crown occupancy index (COI). We additionally measured or recorded the wood density and climbing mechanisms of most liana taxa. Contrary to recent findings, we found significant relationships between most ground-derived metrics and the top-of-view liana leaf coverage over tree crowns. Tree crown infestation by lianas was primarily explained by the load of liana climbing on them, and negatively impacted by tree height. Liana leaf coverage over individual tree crowns was best predicted by liana basal area and negatively mediated by liana wood density, with a higher leaf area to diameter ratio for light-wooded lianas. COI scores were concordant with drone assessments, but two thirds differed from those obtained from drone measurements. Finally, liana patches had a higher light reflectance and variance of spectral responses than tree crowns in all studied spectra. However, the large overlap between them challenges the autodetection of liana patches in canopies.

We found a successional pattern of plant regeneration that seemed to be partly explained by the fast-slow continuum. Plants with high specific leaf area (SLA) colonized bare soil spaces first. Plant regeneration also varied according to changes in phreatic water conductivity and waterlogging. Isotopic analyses of plant species signaled high nutrient availability, increasing the system’s regeneration speed.

In Panama, orey grows in monospecific stands or is the dominant species in inundated mixed forests, mainly along the coasts of Bocas del Toro province and Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé. The species was known to occur in Darien province, in the Pacific, although almost no information on its distribution and forest extension in the region existed. Objective: To describe the structure and floristics of orey forests in Darien, map their extension, and propose a model for their regeneration strategy. Methods: This work is part of a vegetation mapping project of the Matusagaratí complex of wetlands. It includes the use of drones, ground truthing, vegetation sampling through temporary plots, and general plant collecting. A supervised classification of a Landsat satellite image was performed to delimit the orey forest extension. To study the orey forest regeneration strategy, a digitalization of forest gaps in high resolution WorldView-2 and Planet Scope images over years was performed. Gap frequency and turnover time for forest stands were calculated. Results: Several monospecific orey mature forest patches were found in remote areas of the Matusagaratí complex of wetlands, for a total of 1 267 hectares. A description of the floristics and structure of orey forests in Darien is presented. A conceptual model of orey mature forest development and gap regeneration is proposed. Conclusions: Our knowledge of the floristic composition, structure and distribution of orey forests in the Republic of Panama has increased. For the first time, a model about their regeneration strategy is proposed. These forests seem to be evolving to different formations.

In contrast, LiDAR can reflect the three-dimensional features of trees, but lacks spectral information. Therefore, the objective of this study is to devise a methodology for estimating the AGB of urban trees by integrating optical and LiDAR data. Taking Hengqin New Area in China as a case study, this study presents a novel synergy index COLI through a meticulous optimization and sensitivity analysis of optical and LiDAR features, and thoroughly explores the performance of COLI. Subsequently, this study used four estimation models (Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Stacked Sparse Autoencoder networks (SSAE), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR)) and set up multiple sets of experimental variables for validation. The results indicate that: (1) Our proposed COLI index can significantly improve the accuracy of optical and LiDAR variable estimation of AGB (2) The SSAE model has optimal modelling performance for various variable settings. The R2 of the SSAE model using a combination of optical, LiDAR, and COLI variables is 0.801, and the relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSEr) is 14.92%.

The study was carried out in the Santa Rosa National Park Environmental Monitoring Super-Site, Costa Rica, in June 2016. The triangle method was used to derive lambda E from the UAV imagery and the results were compared to lambda E measurements of an eddy covariance system within the coincident eddy flux tower footprint.

Forests are diverse ecosystems, encompass heterogeneous site conditions and experience seasonal fluctuations of rainfall. Our objectives were to quantify ET from a tropical rainforest using high-resolution thermal images and a simple modeling framework. In lowland Sumatra, thermal infrared (TIR) images were taken from an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) of upland and riparian sites during both dry and wet seasons. We predicted ET from land surface temperature data retrieved from the TIR images by applying the DATTUTDUT energy balance model. We further compared the ET estimates to ground-based sap flux measurements for selected trees and assessed the plot-level spatial and temporal variability of ET across sites and seasons. Average ET across sites and seasons was 0.48 mm h-1, which is comparable to ET from a nearby commercial oil palm plantation where this method has been validated against eddy covariance measurements. For given trees, a positive correlation was found between UAV-based ET and tree transpiration derived from ground-based sap flux measurements, thereby corroborating the observed spatial patterns. Evapotranspiration at upland sites was 11% higher than at riparian sites across all seasons. The heterogeneity of ET was lower at upland sites than at riparian sites, and increased from the dry season to the wet season. This seasonally enhanced ET variability can be an effect of local site conditions including partial flooding and diverse responses of tree species to moisture conditions. These results improve our understanding of forest-water interactions in tropical forests and can aid the further development of vegetation-atmosphere models.

The selection of the species was done based on the number of tree samples, which exist in the plot data and in the fact the UAV imagery does not acquire information below the forest canopy. Due to the complexity of the forest, only species that exist in the upper canopy of the remnant were included in the classification. A combination of hyperspectral UAV images and LiDAR point clouds were in the experiment. The hyperspectral images were photogrammetric and radiometric processed to obtain orthomosaics with reflectance factor values.

A central question in tropical ecosystems is understanding palm distribution and abundance. However, accurately identifying and localizing palms in geospatial imagery presents significant challenges due to dense vegetation, overlapping canopies, and variable lighting conditions in mixed-forest landscapes. Addressing this, we introduce PalmProbNet, a probabilistic approach utilizing transfer learning to analyze high-resolution UAV-derived orthomosaic imagery, enabling the detection of palm trees within the dense canopy of the Ecuadorian Rainforest. This approach represents a substantial advancement in automated palm detection, effectively pinpointing palm presence and locality in mixed tropical rainforests. Our process begins by generating an orthomosaic image from UAV images, from which we extract and label palm and non-palm image patches in two distinct sizes. These patches are then used to train models with an identical architecture, consisting of an unaltered pre-trained ResNet-18 and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with specifically trained parameters. Subsequently, PalmProbNet employs a sliding window technique on the landscape orthomosaic, using both small and large window sizes to generate a probability heatmap.

We combined monthly RGB images acquired from an unoccupied aerial vehicle with field surveys to identify gaps in an 18 ha plot installed in an old-growth central Amazon forest. We measured the size and shape of gaps and analyzed their temporal variation and correlation with rainfall over a period of 28 months. We further described associated modes of tree mortality (i.e., snapping, uprooting and standing dead) and branch fall and quantified associated losses of biomass. In total, we detected 32 gaps either in the images or field ranging in area from 9 to 835 m(2). Relatively small gaps (< 39 m(2)) opened by branch fall were the most frequent (11 gaps). Out of 18 gaps for which both field and image data were available, three could not be detected remotely. Gaps observed in the field but not captured on the imagery were relatively small and mainly formed by the fall of branches from live and standing dead trees. Our data show that similar to 17 % of the tree-mortality and branch-fall events only affected the lower canopy and the understory of the forest and are likely neglected by top-of-the-canopy assessments. Regardless of the detection method, the size distribution was best described by a lognormal function for gaps starting from the smallest detected size (9 and 10 m(2) for field and imagery data, respectively), and the Weibull and Power functions for gaps larger than 25 m(2). Properly assessing associated confidence intervals requires larger sample sizes. Repeated field measurements reveal that gap area does not differ significantly among modes of tree mortality or branch fall in central Amazon forests, with the last contributing the least to biomass loss. Predicting mechanisms of gap formation based on associated area and biomass loss remains challenging, which highlights the need for larger datasets. The rate of gap area formation was positively correlated with the frequency of extreme rainfall events, which may be related to a higher frequency of storms propagating extreme rain and wind gusts. While remote sensing has proven to be an accurate and precise method for mapping gaps compared to field data (i.e., ground truth), it is important to note that our sample size was relatively small.

In a tropical rainforest on Sumatra, we studied the relationship between pixel-level ET as derived from high-resolution (similar to 10 cm), near-surface thermography from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and canopy structure as derived from red-green-blue (RGB) image and three-dimensional (3D) point cloud analyses. The 16 derived potential predictors encompassed vegetation height, height variability, vegetation density and reflectance variables. Using regression models, several of the studied variables had a significant linear relationship with ET, but the explained variance was only marginal. However, applying a random forest algorithm including forward feature selection and target oriented cross validation explained substantial parts of the pixel-level variance in ET (R-2 = 0.56-0.65), thus indicating multiple non-linear relationships with interactions among predictor variables. Therein, green leaf index, leaf area density and vegetation height were often the most important variables for the prediction outcome, but their sequence varied among the four study plots.

Here, we developed a method that integrated the Residual Networks 50 (ResNet50) deep learning algorithm with high resolution imagery (c. 0.05 m) from monthly drone surveys done in a 50-ha tropical forest plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panam & PRIME;a, over 2018-2020 to detect a diversity of flowering species in this tree community and to track the timing of flowering throughout the year. We built a comprehensive training library of canopy components (flower, leaf, branch, and shade) from this forest plot throughout the study period, trained a single deep learning model across all drone imagery, and validated it using five-fold cross validation at the pixel scale. We further generated image- and tree-crown-specific supervised classifications to evaluate the deep learning model at the tree-crown scale. Our deep learning method accurately classified flowers (User's accuracy = 95.3 %, Producer's accuracy = 85.8 %) while maintaining high predictive power for the other three classes (Overall accuracy = 98.4 %). Our results also demonstrated high consistency against tree-crown-specific supervised classifications for flower (r2 = 0.85), leaf (r2 = 0.84), and branch (r2 = 0.92) components, with lower agreement observed for the shade component (r2 = 0.59). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in advancing fine-scale flower monitoring in the tropics, with potential to be extended to other regions or other remote sensing platforms with frequent high-resolution monitoring. The method will allow us to better monitor flowering in tropical forests and improve our understanding of how phenology and reproductive success may be affected by climate change.",Panama,China,Wet tropical,Forest,Barro Colorado Island,"9◦9′12.002′′N, 79◦51′2.491′′W",from study,,Multi-rotor,DJI Phantom Pro 4,RGB,built-in RGB camera,5 cm,.05 m,50 ha,50 ha,area with ongoing seed rain collection,yes,Feb 2018 - Feb 2020,monthly,not reported,180 m,Flower identification,ground-truthed tree ID,Phenology,To use drones and Residual Networks to detect flowering events from monthly drone surveys at BCI,Their method was able to accurately identify flowering events.,Used to train and assess model for classifying flowers in RGB imagery,not reported,https://doi. org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.05.022,not reported

Understanding species- and individual-level phenological patterns in tropical forests requires datasets covering large numbers of trees, which can be provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this paper, we test a workflow combining high-resolution RGB images (7 cm/pixel) acquired from UAVs with a machine learning algorithm to monitor tree and species leaf phenology in a tropical forest in Panama. We acquired images for 34 flight dates over a 12-month period. Crown boundaries were digitized in images and linked with forest inventory data to identify species. We evaluated predictions of leaf cover from different models that included up to 14 image features extracted for each crown on each date. The models were trained and tested with visual estimates of leaf cover from 2422 images from 85 crowns belonging to eight species spanning a range of phenological patterns. The best-performing model included both standard color metrics, as well as texture metrics that quantify within-crown variation, with r(2) of 0.84 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.8% in 10-fold cross-validation. In contrast, the model based only on the widely-used Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) index performed relatively poorly (r(2) = 0.52, MAE = 13.6%). These results highlight the utility of texture features for image analysis of tropical forest canopies, where illumination changes may diminish the utility of color indices, such as GCC. The algorithm successfully predicted both individual-tree and species patterns, with mean r(2) of 0.82 and 0.89 and mean MAE of 8.1% and 6.0% for individual- and species-level analyses, respectively.

However, spatially continuous knowledge of palms occurrence is scarce and difficult to obtain with conventional approaches such as field inventories. Here, we developed a new method to map Amazonian palm species at the individual tree crown (ITC) level using RGB images acquired by a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Our approach is based on morphological operations performed in the score maps of palm species derived from a fully convolutional neural network model. We first constructed a labeled dataset by dividing the study area (135 ha within an old-growth Amazon forest) into 28 plots of 250 m x 150 m. Then, we manually outlined all palm trees seen in RGB images with 4 cm pixels. We identified three palm species: Attalea butyracea, Euterpe precatoria and Iriartea deltoidea. We randomly selected 22 plots (80%) for training and six plots (20%) for testing. We changed the plots for training and testing to evaluate the variability in the classification accuracy and assess model generalization. Our method outperformed the average producer's accuracy of conventional patch-wise semantic segmentation (CSS) in 4.7%. Moreover, our method correctly identified, on average, 34.7 percentage points more ITCs than CSS, which tended to merge trees that are close to each other.

These extreme climate events result in higher tree mortality and fraction of dead woody components, phenomena that are currently being reported worldwide as critical indicators of the impacts of climate change on forest diversity and function. In this paper, we assess the accuracy and processing times of ten machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data to detect dead canopy woody components.Materials and Methods:This work was conducted on five secondary dry forest plots located at the Santa Rosa National Park Environmental Monitoring Super Site, Costa Rica.Results:The coverage of dead woody components at the selected secondary dry forest plots was estimated to range from 4.8% to 16.1%, with no differences between the successional stages. Of the ten ML techniques, the support vector machine with radial kernel (SVMR) and random forests (RF) provided the highest accuracies (0.982 vs. 0.98, respectively). Of these two ML algorithms, the processing time of SVMR was longer than the processing time of RF (8735.64 s vs. 989 s).Conclusions:Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to detect and quantify dead woody components, such as dead stands and fallen trees, using a combination of high-resolution UAV data and ML algorithms.

Traditional surveys that involve infiltrating animal habitats could adversely affect the habits and behavior of elusive and cryptic species in response to human presence. Moreover, collecting data through traditional surveys to simultaneously estimate the abundance and demographic rates of communities of species is often prohibitively time-intensive and expensive. This study assesses the scope of drones to non-invasively access the Bukit Tigapuluh Landscape (BTL) in Riau-Jambi, Indonesia, and detect individual elephants of interest. A rotary-wing quadcopter with a vision-based sensor was tested to estimate the elephant population size and age structure.

Very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery from unmanned aircraft systems (UAS's) have been studied as a low cost means for CH estimation at local scales, however, estimation the accuracy is a factor that determines its effectiveness. We evaluated the ability of VHR imagery from UAS's to derive structural attributes, specifically tree-crown area and height, in a tropical forest fragment located in the foothills of the Andes, in the humid tropical forests of the region known as Biogeographic Choco in Colombia South America. We used a structure from motion (SfM) approach to derive the forest fragment's CH, and we applied mean-shift algorithms to identify single tree crowns. We performed accuracy assessment using tree height derived from field campaigns and visual interpretation of VHR imagery. Results showed a RMSE of 3.6 m of the canopy height model (CHM) with a R-2 = 0.75; the total accuracy for delineating tree crowns was 73.9%.

We carried out a spatial sampling of 10 SWI depth profiles in a tropical dry forest. UAV data were collected and analyzed to obtain detailed characterization of soil temperature and canopy status. We then performed a statistical analysis between the VI and land surface temperatures with soil water content and SWI values at different spatial resolutions (3 cm-5 m). Best relationships were used for generating soil water isoscapes for the entire study area. Results suggest that soil water content and SWI values are strongly mediated by canopy parameters (VI). Various VI correlate strongly with soil water content and SWI values across all depths. SWI at the surface depend on land surface temperature (R2 of 0.66 for delta 18O and 0.64 for delta 2H). Strongest overall correlations were found at a spatial resolution of 0.5 m.

The sensors utilized included an RGB camera (ZENMUSE X3) and a multispectral camera (Parrot Sequoia), whose images were used for AGB estimation in a natural tropical mountain forest (TMF) in Southern Ecuador. The total area covered by the sensors included 80 ha at lower elevations characterized by a fast-changing topography and different vegetation covers. From the total area, a core study site of 24 ha was selected for AGB calculation, applying two different methods. The first method used the RGB images and applied the structure for motion (SfM) process to generate point clouds for a subsequent individual tree classification. Per the classification at tree level, tree height (H) and diameter at breast height (DBH) could be determined, which are necessary input parameters to calculate AGB (Mg ha(-1)) by means of a specific allometric equation for wet forests. The second method used the multispectral images to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is the basis for AGB estimation applying an equation for tropical evergreen forests. The obtained results were validated against a previous AGB estimation for the same area using LiDAR data. The study found two major results: (i) The NDVI-based AGB estimates obtained by multispectral drone imagery were less accurate due to the saturation effect in dense tropical forests, (ii) the photogrammetric approach using RGB images provided reliable AGB estimates comparable to expensive LiDAR surveys (R-2: 0.85).
